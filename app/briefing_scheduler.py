"""Background scheduler for daily briefing notifications.

Runs as a single asyncio task started by FastAPI's `startup_event`. Every
`TICK_INTERVAL_SECONDS` it scans `briefing_settings` for users who have
notifications enabled, and for each one whose local time has crossed their
configured send hour (and who hasn't been notified today) it pre-generates
the briefing and writes a notification doc the frontend can poll.

Design notes:
  * One process-wide task — no APScheduler dependency, no second worker.
  * Idempotent. `should_send_now` checks `last_notified_date`, and
    `mark_user_notified` is updated as soon as we deliver, so even if the
    tick interval is short or the task restarts mid-run we never push twice.
  * Errors per-user are swallowed so one bad account never blocks the others.

Operational note:
  This scheduler assumes a single process. The `last_notified_date` field
  in `briefing_settings` does provide cross-process de-duplication, but
  only at minute-level granularity — under heavy multi-instance scaling
  two workers ticking at the same second could both send before either
  records the marker. If we ever scale beyond one managed container instance we
  should add a Firestore-backed lease (e.g. `briefing_scheduler_lock`
  doc + transactional check) to coordinate which instance owns the tick.
